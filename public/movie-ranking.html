<h2>MY BEST THREE SERIES OF ALL TIME </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>How To Get Away With Murder</h3>

<p>Actually i love the movie because the story line is very unpredictable and it keeps you thinking </p>

<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>

<p>This show is just something else, it is thrilling. The action, suspense, intrigue and many more. It can keep you glued to your screen such that you become unaware of your surroundings.

<h3>Suits</h3>

<p>This movie is about Lawyers, the law, and in general the system. I love it because of the story line, how it was setup, and all what you get to learn from it.</p>
